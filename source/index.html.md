# Introduction

Welcome to a single page listing of machine learning models.
This is just a simple web page to list different models, how they can be used, what their equation looks like, and how to use them in various languages.

We have language bindings in Ruby and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate).

# Classification

Machine learning is bulit on the concept of classifying data.
Unfortinately, you can't just click, drag, and drop a business model into a machine learning model and get an ever so magical result that will make people want to buy or use your app more.
The truth is: it requires blood, sweat, and tears.

Machine learning is just a tool.
Most of the time it can work on small to large datasets.
The larger the dataset, the more accurate the classification.
ML is all about the classification of the data.

Example classification goals:

- What products should I recommend to a user?
- How do I specify the genres of a movie or a TV show?
- Given a picture of a dog, which breed is it?
- What is the speed limit for a road?
- If I take a picture of the sky, which area is it in?

Machine learning is more about the _So You Think You Can Clasify_ than a _Internet's Got Talent_.

## Pros, Cons, and Works with

At the beginning of each section, there's a piece on what a certain model works best with.
Pro and con are self explanatory, but works with's vlues are not.
Numerical is just a number that you can plug into a model, whereas nominal could be words.

**Nom·i·nal** /ˈnämən(ə)l/

_adjective_

1. (of a role or status) existing in name only. <br/>
"Thailand retained nominal independence under Japanese military occupation" <br/>

2. (of a price or amount of money) very small; far below the real value or cost. <br/>
"some firms charge only a nominal fee for the service" <br/>
synonyms: token, symbolic

**nu·mer·i·cal** /'n(y)o͞oˈmerək(ə)l/

_adjective_
